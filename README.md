# plugin.video.censoredtv
A Kodi plugin for viewing [CENSORED.TV](https://censored.tv) content

This has been tested on Leia (v18.9). It should work on other versions of Kodi also.

This is an unofficial plugin and is not associated with Censored.TV in any way. A valid subscription is required to use this plugin.

## How to use:

Download the zip file in the "zips" directory (don't use the zip files that Github
creates, they will not work!) Put it somewhere on the network that Kodi can see,
and do the following (Note: you may alternatively follow "How to install from a zip file" in the [official Kodi wiki](https://kodi.wiki/view/Add-on_manager) ):

&ensp;Settings (&#9881;) > System > Add-ons > Unknown sources (turn to "on")

&ensp;Settings (&#9881;) > Add-ons > Install from zip file > (choose the file)
  
In a few seconds you should see "Censored.TV installed correctly". Then go to:

&ensp;Settings (&#9881;) > Add-ons > My addons > Video add-ons > Censored TV > Configuration
  
Enter your Censored.TV logon details. (Be aware these will be stored in plaintext
on the Kodi device). This plugin won't work without a current and valid Censored.TV
logon. Finally go to:

&ensp;Videos > Video add-ons > Censored TV

Now you should be able to view videos!
